          <p>
            As people always say: "There is nothing new under the sun." I research the past for a
            thriving future. Finding a pattern from data and pulling missing pieces together always
            fascinates me. I enjoy telling stories with numbers and talking about the lessons
            learned.

            I am very proud to be a student of the first course delivery of causal machine learning
            at UofT, led by Dr. Nazanin Khazra. Now, I am one of the very few people in Canada that
            has competent knowledge of Causal Inference in a Business/Economic setting, where Python
            packages like SkLearn, DoWhy, EconML, and LightGBM are heavily used. Check out the{" "}

            I have 4 years of project experience in a variety of fields - Data analytics/science,
            Research, Business analytics, and even teaching! I appreciate the opportunities where I
            mastered skills in Python, SQL, R, Tableau, PowerBI, STATA, and SAS for machine learning
            and visualization.

            I am an interest-driven person; the thirst for knowledge drives me forward. But now a
            more pressing question arises: What can I do with the knowledge? If I'm just selfishly
            keeping it locked away in a corner of my brain, then maybe I'm no different from others
            who have nothing to offer in this field. I'm desperately looking for some like-minded
            partners. Together, we can do something different.
